Idea: Let's build two models:
    	1). Using ECG Sensor data from Apple Watch to detect irregularities and

    2). Using accelerometer, gyroscope, and barometric sensors to determine physical activity. this will help us profile if someone is more prone to heart disease based on their physical lifestyle.

The real life implementation is to have a feedback loop between these two models on all smart watches (not just Apple Watch). This way people won't have to worry about spending a lot of money on an Apple watch just to detect their heartbeat irregularities and report this data back to doctors. They can cut half the costs and just install a free application that performs this instead.
