Idea: 

    1). Use makerspace lab and find a more expensive version and justify that as our full package

The real life implementation is to have a feedback loop between these two models on all smart watches (not just Apple Watch). This way people won't have to worry about spending a lot of money on an Apple watch just to detect their heartbeat irregularities and report this data back to doctors. They can cut half the costs and just install a free application that performs this instead.
